# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Overview

This is a PARA-method Obsidian vault for personal knowledge management. There is no code to build or test.

## PARA Folder Structure

- `00_Inbox/` - Temporary capture zone; items here need processing
- `01_Projects/` - Active, time-bound work with deadlines
- `02_Areas/` - Ongoing responsibilities without end dates
- `03_Resources/` - Reference materials and evergreen knowledge
- `04_Archive/` - Completed/inactive items preserved for reference
- `05_Attachments/` - Images, PDFs, and binary files
- `06_Metadata/` - Templates and documentation about the vault itself

## Working in This Vault

**Thinking Mode**: When exploring or researching, ask questions, search existing notes, and find connections before creating new content.

**Writing Mode**: When creating deliverables, generate drafts, structure content, and produce final outputs.

## Key Operations

- **Processing Inbox**: Review items in `00_Inbox/` and move them to appropriate PARA folders
- **Creating Projects**: Use templates from `06_Metadata/Templates/`; each project gets a subfolder in `01_Projects/`
- **Finding Connections**: Search across folders to link related concepts using `[[wiki links]]`
- **Archiving**: Move completed projects to `04_Archive/` with a completion summary

## File Conventions

- Dates in filenames: `YYYY-MM-DD` format
- Attachments: Use descriptive names with dates, store in `05_Attachments/Organized/`
- Links: Use Obsidian wiki-link syntax `[[Note Name]]`
