# Metadata

Documentation about this space itself.

## What You'll Find Here

Information about how this thinking space is organized:

- **Reference/** — Guides and documentation
- **Templates/** — Structures I use for different note types

## For the Curious

If you're interested in how I organize my thinking, this folder shows the underlying structure. The templates reveal the patterns I use when capturing different types of information.

## Current Contents

Basic templates and setup documentation. This section will grow as the space develops its own conventions.
