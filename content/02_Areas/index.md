# Areas

Ongoing interests, responsibilities, and completed projects I maintain over time.

## What You'll Find Here

Areas are the continuous threads in my life—things I care about that don't have finish lines:

- Personal projects which are past MVP
- Skills I'm developing
- Interests I explore regularly
- Responsibilities I maintain

Unlike projects, these evolve rather than complete.

## How Areas Work

Each area collects related thoughts, resources, and progress over time. Projects often spawn from areas when I want to focus on something specific. Sometimes an area is the result of an initial project that has reached a defined goal, the `1.0` stage.
