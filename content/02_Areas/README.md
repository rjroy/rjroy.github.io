# Areas

Ongoing interests and responsibilities I maintain over time.

## What You'll Find Here

Areas are the continuous threads in my life—things I care about that don't have finish lines:

- Professional domains I work in
- Skills I'm developing
- Interests I explore regularly
- Responsibilities I maintain

Unlike projects, these evolve rather than complete.

## How Areas Work

Each area collects related thoughts, resources, and progress over time. Projects often spawn from areas when I want to focus on something specific.

## Current Areas

No areas documented yet—this space is being set up.
