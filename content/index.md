# Ron's Broadcast Cache

A public window into how I organize my thoughts, projects, and ideas.

## What is This?

This is my digital garden, a place where I capture, develop, and share my thinking. Unlike a blog with polished posts, this is a living workspace. You'll find ideas at various stages: some fully formed, others still germinating.

## How It's Written

I work with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) as my ghost writer. I provide the ideas, direction, and editorial judgment. Claude helps me get words on the page.

Sometimes I'll dictate rough thoughts and ask Claude to shape them into coherent prose. Other times I'll describe what I want to communicate and let Claude draft it. I always review, edit, and take responsibility for what gets published.

This isn't about hiding AI involvement. It's about being transparent: the thinking is mine, the collaboration is real, and the tool is acknowledged. If you're curious about this workflow, that's part of what I'm exploring here.

## How It's Organized

I use the PARA method to organize content:

```
00_Inbox/       → Fresh captures, unprocessed thoughts
01_Projects/    → Active work with clear goals
02_Areas/       → Ongoing interests and responsibilities
03_Resources/   → Reference materials and evergreen notes
04_Archive/     → Completed work and past explorations
05_Attachments/ → Images and files
06_Metadata/    → Templates and documentation
```

## Current State

This space is just getting started. You're seeing the scaffolding before the building. Check back as content develops.

## Navigating

Feel free to explore any folder. Each has its own `index` explaining what you'll find there. Some notes link to each other using `[[wiki links]]`. If you see these in raw markdown, they reference other notes in this collection.

## About Me

I'm Ron, a professional developer for nearly 30 years. The past year has brought a whirlwind of progress in AI-assisted development, and I'd be remiss not to explore it seriously. This space captures that exploration: projects I'm building with these tools, and reflections on what it means to work alongside AI.
