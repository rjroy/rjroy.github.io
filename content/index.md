# Ron's Broadcast Cache

A public window into how I organize my thoughts, projects, and ideas.

## What is This?

This is my digital garden—a place where I capture, develop, and share my thinking. Unlike a blog with polished posts, this is a living workspace. You'll find ideas at various stages: some fully formed, others still germinating.

## How It's Organized

I use the PARA method to organize content:

```
00_Inbox/       → Fresh captures, unprocessed thoughts
01_Projects/    → Active work with clear goals
02_Areas/       → Ongoing interests and responsibilities
03_Resources/   → Reference materials and evergreen notes
04_Archive/     → Completed work and past explorations
05_Attachments/ → Images and files
06_Metadata/    → Templates and documentation
```

## Current State

This space is just getting started. You're seeing the scaffolding before the building. Check back as content develops.

## Navigating

Feel free to explore any folder. Each has its own README explaining what you'll find there. Notes link to each other using `[[wiki links]]`—if you see these in raw markdown, they reference other notes in this collection.

## About Me

I'm Ronald. This vault reflects my professional interests, side projects, and ongoing learning.
