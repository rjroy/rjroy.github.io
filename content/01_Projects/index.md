# Projects

Active work with defined goals and timelines.

## What You'll Find Here

Projects are focused efforts I'm currently working on—things with a clear finish line:

- Work with specific deliverables
- Learning endeavors with concrete outcomes
- Creative efforts with completion criteria
- Experiments with defined scope

Each project has its own folder containing research, progress notes, and outputs.

## How Projects Differ from Areas

Projects end. They have objectives I can check off. When something becomes ongoing without a clear endpoint, it moves to Areas instead.

## Current Projects

No active projects yet—this space is being set up.
