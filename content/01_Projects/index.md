# Projects

Active endeavors with defined goals and timelines.

## What You'll Find Here

Projects are focused efforts with a clear finish line: learning endeavors with concrete outcomes, creative efforts with completion criteria, experiments with defined scope. Each project has its own folder containing research, progress notes, and outputs.

## How Projects Differ from Areas

Projects end. They have objectives I can check off. When something becomes ongoing without a clear endpoint, it moves to Areas instead.

If you don't define what done means, you'll never get there. Even for personal projects such as those here, you must define done.

## Current Projects

- [[01_Projects/AI-as-Your-Partner/index|AI as Your Partner]]: Exploring what makes good AI rules files. Not universal best practices, but personal configurations that make AI work for *you*.
- [[01_Projects/Exploring-Whimsy/index|Exploring Whimsy]]: There is a philosophy that minimalist design is what allows creativity. But what about color? Kooky fonts? Evocative imagery? Whimsy? Does this provide too much direction? Or open the door?

Any project that's completed is either [[04_Archive/index|archived]] because there's nothing left to be said, or it's moved into [[02_Areas/index|maintenance mode]] where I'm just fixing bugs and small tweaks. I may at a later date do a `2.0` of these now Areas which will be a new project here.
