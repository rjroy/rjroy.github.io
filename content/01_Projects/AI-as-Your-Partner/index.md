# AI as Your Partner

## Project Overview

**Status**: Active

This project explores two related questions about working with AI tools:

1. **How do you configure AI to work well?** (mechanics)
2. **What does it mean to partner with AI?** (philosophy)

The first question led to a published article on rules files. The second emerged from trying to understand *why* those rules work.

## Two Threads

### The Mechanics: What Makes Good Rules Files

How to structure AI instructions, where to put them, what to include.

- [[ai-rules-research-summary|Rules Research Summary]] — The original research on universal vs. personal rules, the spectrum model, format convergence
- [[02_Areas/AI-as-Your-Partner/what-makes-good-ai-rules-files|What Makes Good AI Rules Files]] — The published article

**Key insight:** Format converges (everyone needs the same sections), but content remains personal (how you fill them out reflects your values and workflow).

### The Philosophy: What is Partnership

What makes collaboration with AI feel like partnership rather than delegation.

- [[What-is-Partnership|What is Partnership?]] — Working notes on the philosophy underneath the rules
- [[research/Research-AI-Partnership-Perspectives|Research: AI Partnership (Claude)]] — Academic/philosophical synthesis
- [[research/Research-AI-Partnership-ChatGPT|Research: AI Partnership (ChatGPT)]] — Practitioner-focused synthesis
- [[research/Research-Human-Partnership-Patterns|Research: Human Partnership Patterns]] — Cross-domain patterns from marriage, business, creative, and high-stakes partnerships

**Key insight:** With AI, you're not just defining the partnership contract. You're defining the partner. Rules files don't negotiate with an existing entity; they shape what entity shows up.

## The Connection

The mechanics article answers "how do I write good rules?" The philosophy work answers "why do those rules create something that feels like partnership?"

The answer: partnership emerges when you teach the AI *how to think about work*, not just *what work to do*. "Research before acting" isn't a task boundary; it's a reasoning pattern. "Never skip tests" isn't scope; it's a value. The rules are training, not just configuration.
