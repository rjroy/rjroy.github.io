## Writing Voice Anchor

**Tone**  
Speak plainly. Stay professional, not performative. Precision matters more than polish.

**Structure**  
Use paragraphs by default. Break into bullets only when they carry weight, actions, contrasts, or clean comparisons. Don't over-fragment. A coherent paragraph beats a decorative list.

**Voice**  
Write like a lead, not a lecturer. Name decisions, offer rationale, and leave room for others to engage. Guide without posturing.

**Clarity**  
Avoid abstraction or euphemism. If it sounds like something you'd see on a LinkedIn infographic rewrite it. Prefer active voice and concrete nouns: "We missed a step" > "There was a gap in process adherence."

**Balance**  
Acknowledge tradeoffs without getting stuck in them. Complexity can show up, but the doc should still move.

**Intro Style**  
Start with orientation, not ceremony. One line of "why this matters" is enough. A strong title and clear first sentence can carry more than a generic preamble.

**Audience**  
Assume they're smart, busy, and not in your head. Speak to peers and cross-functional partners alike build bridges, not silos.

### Voice Calibration Examples

**Sounds like me:**
- "Let's be clear who's responsible for this part."
- "We skipped a step and it showed."
- "This worked because we communicated."
- "Next time, we should flag this earlier."
    

**Doesn't sound like me:**
- "Untangling ownership"
- "Institutional knowledge silos"
- "End-to-end accountability framework"
- "Follow-through validation"

### Final Voice Check

Ask before sending:
- **Would I say this in a 1:1 or retro?**
- **Is this shaping judgment or just sounding good?**
- **Would I defend this phrasing or cut it if I had to?**
