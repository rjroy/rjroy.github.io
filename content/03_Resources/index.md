# Resources

Reference materials and evergreen knowledge.

## What You'll Find Here

This is my personal knowledge base—information I've collected and synthesized:

- Notes on concepts and frameworks
- Summaries of books and articles
- Technical references
- Mental models and tools for thinking
- Collected examples and case studies

## How Resources Differ

Resources aren't tied to specific projects or timeframes. They're reference material—things I might need someday, topics I find interesting, knowledge worth preserving.

## Current Resources

No resources added yet—this space is being set up.
