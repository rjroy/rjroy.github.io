# Archive

Completed work and past explorations preserved for reference.

## What You'll Find Here

The archive holds what's no longer active but worth keeping:

- Completed projects with their outcomes
- Past experiments and what I learned
- Old ideas that didn't develop further
- Historical notes for context

## Why Archive Instead of Delete

Past work informs future thinking. Completed projects show how I approached problems. Failed experiments reveal what didn't work. The archive is institutional memory.

## Current Archive

Nothing archived yet—this space is being set up.
