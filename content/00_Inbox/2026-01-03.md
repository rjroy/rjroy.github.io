# 2026-01-03

## Capture
- [ ] [20:39] Judgment Engine needs a revamp. I created it when I didn't trust AI to preserve my voice. I still don't, but I'm now not looking for it to be a writing tool unless I want it to do the writing. There's a difference. The whole thing was built around protecting voice from AI rewriting. Now I need to rethink what it's actually for.
