## Capture

- [x] [17:45] Next I'll want to do some screenshots and write up for Adventure Engine of Corvran
- [17:45] Should I expand the Memory Loop page? Or is the purely AI generated sufficient?
- [x] [21:19] I need to talk about how I name things. "Because it's fun"
- [x] [21:20] I need to talk about why memory loop has a bonkers color scheme.  "Because it's fun and it keeps me from getting too serious about it. Also I can handle the noise or need it."
- [x] [21:20] I should consider a "stop/abort" future for the think tab. And also consider removing the 50 turn limit with that feature. And what about permission hooks?
