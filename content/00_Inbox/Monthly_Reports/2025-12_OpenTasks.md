## From 2025-12-30

- [ ] [20:54] I should consider asking Claude to make a tutorial on how to build this application. Or the adventure engine. Or both.

## Future/Deferred

- [ ] Revisit in Feb: "In what ways can you empower yourself to iterate, experiment, and change course more freely?" (too early to evaluate while Memory Loop is fresh; see what friction emerges after real use)

## Summary

**Total open tasks:** 2

- 1 actionable consideration (tutorial creation)
- 1 scheduled future review (February revisit)
