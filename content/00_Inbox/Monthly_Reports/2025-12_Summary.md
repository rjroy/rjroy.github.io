## Overview

The end of December focused heavily on **Memory Loop** development and documentation work for the digital garden. A clear theme emerged around articulating personal philosophy on AI collaboration and design choices.

---

## Key Projects

### Memory Loop
Active development continued throughout the period:
- Added a task view to the `Recall` tab, fitting the Ground->Capture->Think->Recall cycle
- Bug identified and recorded: send button sometimes disabled on Think tab despite text being present
- Considered adding a "stop/abort" feature for the Think tab
- Discussed removing the 50-turn limit and exploring permission hooks

### Adventure Engine of Corvran
- Screenshots and write-up planned

### Digital Garden / Documentation
- Considered expanding the Memory Loop page (vs. AI-generated content)
- Planned write-up of CLAUDE.md files to express AI collaboration philosophy

---

## Completed Tasks

From 2025-12-29:
- [x] Screenshots and write-up planning for Adventure Engine of Corvran
- [x] Memory Loop page expansion consideration
- [x] Naming conventions discussion ("because it's fun")
- [x] Color scheme rationale for Memory Loop ("keeps me from getting too serious")
- [x] Stop/abort feature consideration for Think tab

From 2025-12-30:
- [x] Memory Loop bug recorded as GitHub issue
- [x] CLAUDE.md write-up planning
- [x] Image tweaking decision (road visibility)

## Key Themes

### Design Philosophy: "Because It's Fun"
Two entries explicitly capture the reasoning behind unconventional choices:
- Naming things: "Because it's fun"
- Memory Loop's color scheme: "Because it's fun and it keeps me from getting too serious about it. Also I can handle the noise or need it."

### AI Collaboration Observations
- Claude's tendency to add debug logs then delete them (noted as a training gap: "logging is good")
- Idea: have Claude audit a project file by file, though this raises the question "what does quality mean?"

### Ground->Capture->Think->Recall Cycle
The task view addition explicitly maps to this established workflow pattern, with `Recall` having a sub-concept of `Adjust`.

---

## Reflections / Questions Raised

- Should the Memory Loop page be expanded, or is AI-generated content sufficient?
- What does "quality" look like for a file-by-file project audit?
- How to train AI assistants that logging is valuable (not something to clean up)?

---

## Looking Ahead

- February: Revisit "In what ways can you empower yourself to iterate, experiment, and change course more freely?" after Memory Loop sees real use
- Potential tutorial creation for Memory Loop or Adventure Engine
