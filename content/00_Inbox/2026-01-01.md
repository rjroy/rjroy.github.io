## Capture

- [20:49] Should I customize my 404 page for my github.io site?
- [20:52] I need a definition or unit command or something for new vaults. Yes this is based on the https://github.com/heyitsnoah/claudesidian but that's just a start. And for instance that clashed with the quartz setup.
- [20:57] I need a different font for the attribution of the inspiration quotes.  The title font is fine if you cannot read it because you know what it says, but the attribution fails the "20th time" test.
