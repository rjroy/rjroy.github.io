## Capture

- [08:08] Adding a task view to memory loop. This will be on the `Recall` tab. This will keep it within the Ground->Capture->Think->Recall cycle. `Recall` has a sub concept that is `Adjust`. This is just another form of that.
- [21:00] Claude adds logs to debug stuff then deletes them. I need to train it that logging is good. The fact that the training data doesn't have logging is bad.
- [21:17] I think it might be a good idea to have Claude audit a project file by file. But what does that look like? Do I need to fully define "what quality is" first?
