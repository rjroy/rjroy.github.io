# Inbox

The capture zone—raw thoughts before they find their home.

## What You'll Find Here

This is where ideas land before I've had time to process them:

- Quick thoughts and observations
- Links I want to revisit
- Notes from conversations
- Random ideas that popped up
- Things I'm still figuring out

## Why It Exists

Not every thought arrives fully formed. The inbox lets me capture without the friction of deciding where something belongs. Items here eventually migrate to Projects, Areas, or Resources—or get discarded if they don't hold up.

## Current Contents

This section is currently empty as I'm just setting up this space.
