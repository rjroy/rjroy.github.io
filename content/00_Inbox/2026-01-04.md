## Capture

- [12:52] It would be nice to be able to paste an image into Memory Loop
- [12:59] Memory Loop: I'm not sure what the purpose of the `CLAUDE.md` being visible on the select a vault page.  Might be better if it took tags from some file instead? Or just nothing.  Also right now it takes the title from the first line of the CLAUDE.md, but if you ask Claude to build that file then that will be `CLAUDE.md`.
