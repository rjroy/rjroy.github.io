## Capture

- [x] [10:24] Memory loop has a bug on the think tab sometimes the send button is disabled, even though there is text to be sent. **Recorded as github issue.**

## Future
- [ ] Revisit in Feb: "In what ways can you empower yourself to iterate, experiment, and change course more freely?" — too early to evaluate while Memory Loop is fresh; see what friction emerges after real use
