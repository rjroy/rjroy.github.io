## Capture

- [x] [10:24] Memory loop has a bug on the think tab sometimes the send button is disabled, even though there is text to be sent. **Recorded as github issue.**

- [ ] [20:53] I want to do a write up of my CLAUDE.md files. They express my philosophy of working with AI.
- [ ] [20:54] I should consider asking Claude to make a tutorial on how to build this application. Or the adventure engine. Or both.

- [x] [21:27] Do I want to tweak the image any more? The only thing missing is the road leading to the left being visible. Is that okay?

## Future
- [ ] Revisit in Feb: "In what ways can you empower yourself to iterate, experiment, and change course more freely?" — too early to evaluate while Memory Loop is fresh; see what friction emerges after real use
